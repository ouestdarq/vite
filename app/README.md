## Vite

`VITE_SERVER_` environement variables need to be set in order for https, hmr, and vite-plugin-restart to work correctly.

`VITE_SERVER_KEY` and `VITE_SERVER_CERT` point to the ssl/tls certificate key pair location.

`VITE_SERVER_CERT` serves also as the location set to watch changes and restart whenever certificates are updated via the vite-plugin-restart.

`VITE_SERVER_HMR` Â¡Important! Laravel only. Serves to indicate laravel where hmr is coming from.
